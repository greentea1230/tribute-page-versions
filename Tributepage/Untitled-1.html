                <h2 id="title"> Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D </h2>
                <div id="tribute info">
                    <p> Dr. Francis Collins is a geneticist-physician and a former director of the US
                        National Insititute of Health. He earned his Ph.D in physical chemistry from Yale University and
                        his M.D. from the Univeristy of North Carolina. </p>
                    <h3> Genetics </h3>
                    <p> He is known for leading the Human Genome Project, which began in
                        1990 and concluded in 2003, with the primary objective of identifying, mapping, and sequencing
                        the human genome. It was conducted in partnership with numerous universities from around the
                        world including in countries such as the UK, China, France, and Japan.</p>
                    <p> Dr. Collins assumed leadership of the project in 1993, leading the project to achieve various
                        milestones such as producing the first complete sequence of a human chromosome, producing the
                        first complete sequence of a bacterial genome, and eventually producing the most complete
                        sequencing of the human genome at around 92%.</p>
                    <h3> Medicine </h3>
                    <p> In the field of medicine Dr. Collins's lab has identified key disease genes for various
                        diseases such as cystic fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome
                        (HGPS).</p>
                    <p> His laboratory has given special focus on finding treatment options for the
                        aforementioned HGPS and type-2 diabetes such as gene therapy and pharmaceutical treatment. </p>
